### **Deep Learning: My Journey into Neural Networks! üß†**

Welcome to my personal playground for all things Deep Learning! This repository is where I keep track of my studies and experiments in the fascinating world of neural networks. It's a collection of labs and projects that helped me understand the core concepts and build some cool AI models.

#### **What You'll Find Here üöÄ**

This repository is structured around a series of labs, each focusing on a key aspect of deep learning:

*   **Lab 1: Python Basics:** Getting comfortable with the Python fundamentals needed for deep learning.
*   **Lab 2: Model Training with Logistic Regression:** Diving into the basics of training models, starting with logistic regression.
*   **Lab 3: Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLP):** Building and understanding the foundational neural network architecture.

#### **My Learning Goals ‚ú®**

My goal with these labs is to:

*   Solidify my understanding of deep learning theory.
*   Gain hands-on experience with popular deep learning frameworks.
*   Develop practical skills in building, training, and evaluating neural networks.
*   Explore different architectures and techniques in deep learning.

#### **Tech I'm Using üõ†Ô∏è**

*   Python
*   TensorFlow / Keras (likely, given the context of deep learning)
*   Jupyter Notebook
